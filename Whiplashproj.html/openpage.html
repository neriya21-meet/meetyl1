	<h1>Whiplash</h1>
	<p>One day there was a little girl. Her name was Mary. Mary saw many things in her miserable life. she saw her mother die and her father leave. She saw her brother turn into a drunk and her sister into a whore,
but she never saw herself. 

She didn't see herself when she walked down the lane or when she went to the market. She didn't see the way her hands broke whatever she touched and hurt whoever she loved.

At night, she would lay in her little bed, crying her little tears and the walls around would shake from the weight of her sadness. Her brother would drink deeper. Her sister would sleep the nights away with strangers. Her small world hurt.

One morning, the sun peeked into her small room.</p>
