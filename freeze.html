	<h1>Whiplash</h1>
	<p> Frozen in place, Mary can only watch as the car looms over her, headlights barring her soul for all to see. Covering her eyes, a jarring coldness passes through her. Opening her eyes, the car is gone, passed right through her.<div> The truth crashes down on her, memoories long suppressed rise bubbling to the surface. A road trip with her parents. Her tenth birthday. Her dad losing control of the car. The cliffside lookming. Screams, and then - nothing</div></p>
